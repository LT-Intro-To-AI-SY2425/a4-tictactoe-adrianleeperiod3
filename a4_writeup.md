# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?

The most difficult part of the tic tac toe had to be trying to figure out the board declaration myself as declaring a list that way was pretty unintuitive. 

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.

A computer player could be added by program which randomly selects a number from 0-8 and places a mark there if it is not already taken. More complex programs could aim for spaces that are adjacent to their previous points. 

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.

A statistical model will probably be best for this realistically, however the previously mentioned concept which aims for spaces adjacent to its own previous marks would be decent at the game, as would at least be able to tie games reasonably well.
